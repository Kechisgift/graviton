## Blackbox Testing Howto

### What is TEAL Blackbox Testing?

TEAL Blackbox Testing lets you treat your TEAL program as a black box that for every received input produces an output and other observable effects. You can create reports that summarize those effects, and turn the _reports_ into _program invariant conjectures_ which you then check with _sequence assertions_.

### Why Blackbox Testing?

Here are some use cases:

* by allowing you to assert that certain invariants hold over a large set of inputs you gain greater confidence that your TEAL programs and AVM smart contracts work as designed
* when tweaking, refactoring or optimizing your TEAL source, ensure that no regressions have occured
* allows AVM developers to practice the art of TTDD (TEAL Test Driven Development)

## Simple TEAL Blackbox Toolkit Example: Program for $`x^2`$

Consider the following [TEAL program](https://github.com/algorand/py-algorand-sdk/blob/23c21170cfb19652d5da854e499dca47eabb20e8/x/blackbox/teal/lsig_square.teal) that purportedly computes $`x^2`$:

```plain
#pragma version 6
arg 0
btoi
callsub square_0
return

// square
square_0:
store 0
load 0
pushint 2 // 2
exp
retsub
```

You'd like to write some unit tests to validate that it computes what you think it should, and also make **assertions** about the:

* program's opcode cost
* program's stack
* stack's height
* scratch variables
* final log message (this is especially useful for [ABI-compliant programs](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/smart-contracts/ABI/))
* status (**PASS**, **REJECT** or _erroring_)
* error conditions that are and aren't encountered

Even better, before making fine-grained assertions you'd like to get a sense of what the program is doing on a large set of inputs so you can discover program invariants. The TEAL Blackbox Toolkit's recommended approach for enabling these goals is to:

* start by making basic assertions and validate them using dry runs (see "**Basic Assertions**" section below)
* execute the program on a run-sequence of inputs and explore the results (see "**EDRA: Exploratory Dry Run Analysis**" section below)
* create invariants for the entire run-sequence and assert that the invariants hold (see "**Advanced: Asserting Invariants on a Dry Run Sequence**" section below)

> Becoming a TEAL Blackbox Toolkit Ninja involves 10 steps as described below
### Dry Run Environment Setup

**STEP 1**. Start with a running local node and make note of Algod's port number (for our [standard sandbox](https://github.com/algorand/sandbox) this is `4001`)

**STEP 2**. Set the `ALGOD_PORT` value in [x/testnet.py](https://github.com/algorand/py-algorand-sdk/blob/5faf79ddb56327a0e036ff4e21a39b52535751ae/x/testnet.py#L6) to this port number. (The port is set to `60000` by default because [SDK-testing](https://github.com/algorand/algorand-sdk-testing) bootstraps with this setting on Circle and also to avoid conflicting locally with the typical sandbox setup)

### TEAL Program for Testing: Logic Sig v. App

**STEP 3**. Next, you'll need to figure out if your TEAL program should be a Logic Signature or an Application. Each of these program _modes_ has its merits, but I won't get into the pros/cons here. From a Blackbox Test's perspective, the main difference is how each receives its arguments from the program executor. Logic sigs rely on the [arg opcode](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/avm/teal/opcodes/#arg-n) while apps rely on [txna ApplicationArgs i](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/avm/teal/opcodes/#txna-f-i). In our $`x^2`$ **logic sig** example, you can see on [line 2](https://github.com/algorand/py-algorand-sdk/blob/23c21170cfb19652d5da854e499dca47eabb20e8/x/blackbox/teal/lsig_square.teal#L2) that the `arg` opcode is used. Because each argument opcode (`arg` versus `ApplicationArgs`) is exclusive to one mode, any program that takes input will execute succesfully in _one mode only_.

**STEP 4**. Write the TEAL program that you want to test. You can inline the test as described here or follow the approach of `x/blackbox/blackbox_test.py` and save under `x/blackbox/teal`. So following the inline
appraoch we begin our TEAL Blackbox script with an <a name="teal">inline teal source variable</a>:

```python
teal = """#pragma version 6
arg 0
btoi
callsub square_0
return

// square
square_0:
store 0
load 0
pushint 2 // 2
exp
retsub"""
```

### The TEAL Blackbox Toolkit's Utitlity Classes

The TEAL Blackbox Toolkit comes with the following utility classes:

* `DryRunExecutor` - facility to execute dry run's on apps and logic sigs
* `DryRunTransactionResult` - class encapsulating a single app or logic sig dry run transaction and for making assertions about the dry run
* `SequenceAssertion` - class for asserting invariants about a _sequence_ of dry run executions in a declarative fashion

### Basic Assertions

When executing a dry run using  `DryRunExecutor` you'll get back `DryRunTransactionResult` objects. Such objects have
**assertable properties** which can be used to validate the dry run.

**STEP 4**. Back to our $`x^2`$ example, and assuming the `teal`  variable is defined [as above](#teal). You can run the following:

```python
algod = get_algod()
x = 9
args = (x,)
dryrun_result = DryRunExecutor.dryrun_logicsig(algod, teal, args)
assert dryrun_result.status() == "PASS"
assert dryrun_result.stack_top() == x ** 2
```

Some available _assertable properties_ are:

* `stack_top()`
* `last_log()`
* `cost()`
* `status()`
* `final_scratch()`
* `error()`
* `max_stack_height()`

See the [DryRunTransactionResult class comment](https://github.com/algorand/py-algorand-sdk/blob/b2a3366b7bc976e0610429c186b7968a7f1bbc76/algosdk/testing/teal_blackbox.py#L371) for more assertable properties and details.

### Printing out the TEAL Stack Trace for a Failing Assertion

**STEP 5**. The `DryRunTransactionResult`'s `report()` method lets you print out
a handy report in the case of a failing assertion. Let's intentionally break the test case above by claiming that $`x^2 = x^3`$ for $`x=2`$ and print out this _report_ when our silly assertion fails:

```python
algod = get_algod()
x = 2
args = (x,)
dryrun_result = DryRunExecutor.dryrun_logicsig(algod, teal, args)

# This one's ok
expected, actual =  "PASS", dryrun_result.status()
assert expected == actual, dryrun_result.report(args, f"expected {expected} but got {actual}")

# This one's absurd! x^3 != x^2
expected, actual = x ** 3, dryrun_result.stack_stop()
assert expected == actual, dryrun_result.report(args, f"expected {expected} but got {actual}")
```

If we run the test we'll get the following printout (this is for pytest, but other testing frameworks should be similar):
```sh
E               AssertionError: ===============
E               <<<<<<<<<<<expected 8 but got 4>>>>>>>>>>>>>

E               ===============
E       assert 8 == 4
```

In particular, we can:

* Track the program execution by viewing its **App Trace**
  * 2 was assigned to **scratch slot #0** at step 5
  * the stack ended up with **4** on top
  * the run **PASS**'ed
* Read the message parameter that was provided and which explains in English what went wrong: `<<<<<<<<<<<expected 8 but got 4>>>>>>>>>>>>>`

### EDRA: Exploratory Dry Run Analysis

Let's expand our investigation from a single dry-run to multiple runs or a **run sequence**. In other words, given a sequence of inputs, observe _assertable properties_ for the corresponding
executions, and conjecture some program invariants. To aid in the investigation we'll generate a report in CSV format (Comma Separated Values) where:

* columns represent _assertable properties_ of dry-runs, and
* rows represents dry-run executions for specific inputs

**STEP 6**. Back to our $`x^2`$ example, here's how to generate a report with 1 row for each of the inputs `0, 1, ... , 15`: 

```python
algod = get_algod()
inputs = [(x,) for x in range(16)]
dryrun_results = DryRunExecutor.dryrun_logicsig_on_sequence(algod, teal, inputs)
csv = DryRunTransactionResult.csv_report(inputs, dryrun_results)
print(csv)
```

Note: that each element in the `inputs` array `(x,)` is itself a tuple as `args` given to a dry run execution need to be `Iterable` (remember, that these will be passed to a TEAL program which may take one, several, or no inputs at all).
At this point, you'll be able to look at your [dry run sequence results](https://github.com/algorand/py-algorand-sdk/blob/1bc7b8fcf21401608cece65507c36d1f6dbad531/algosdk/testing/teal_blackbox.py#L713) and conduct some analysis. For the $`x^2`$ example if you load the CSV in Google sheets and reformat a bit it will look like:

<img width="465" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/291133/158812699-318169e2-487c-4dac-b97b-a9db8148b638.png">

Perusing the above, it looks right: 

* column `D` **Arg 00** has the input $`x`$ (it's the argument at index 0)
* column `A` contains the **Run** number
* column `E`  **top of stack** does indeed store $`x^2`$ at the program's termination
* column `B` **Status** of each runs **PASS**es _except for **Run 1** with **Arg 00** = 0_. (The first run **REJECT**s because $`0^2 = 0`$ and TEAL programs reject when the top of the stack is 0)
* column `G` shows scratch slot **s@000** which stores the value of $`x`$ (except for the case $`x = 0`$ in which appears empty; in fact, slots always default to the zero value and an **<a name="0val-artifact">artifact</a>** of dry-runs is that they do not report when 0-values get stored into previously empty slots as no state change actually occurs)
* column `F` **max stack height** is always 2. The final observation makes sense because there is no branching or looping in the program.

**STEP 7**. We can re-cast these observed effects in `Columns E, B, G, F` as **program invariant conjectures** written in Python as follows:

* `dryrun_result.stack_top() == x ** 2`
* `dryrun_result.max_stack_height() == 2`
* `dryrun_result.status() == ("REJECT" if x == 0 else "PASS")`
* `dryrun_result.final_scratch() == ({} if x == 0 else {0: x})`

### Advanced: Asserting Invariants on a Dry Run Sequence

The final and most advanced topic of this Howto is to turn _program invariant conjectures_ into
**sequence assertions**. That is, let's take the information we gleaned in our EDRA CSV report, 
and create an integration test out of it. There are two ways to achieve this goal:

* Procedural sequence assertions
* Declarative sequence assertions

#### Procedural Blackbox Dry Run Sequence Assertions

**STEP 8**. The procedural approach takes the _program invariant conjectures_ and simply asserts them 
inside of a for loop that iterates over the inputs and dry runs. One can call each dry run
execution independently, or use `DryRunExecutor`'s convenience methods `dryrun_app_on_sequence()` and
`dryrun_logicsig_on_sequence()`. For example, let's assert that the above invariants hold for all
$`x \leq 100`$:

```python
algod = get_algod()
inputs = [(x,) for x in range(101)]
dryrun_results = DryRunExecutor.dryrun_logicsig_on_sequence(algod, teal, inputs)
for i, dryrun_result in enumerate(dryrun_results):
    args = inputs[i]
    x = args[0]
    assert dryrun_result.stack_top() == x ** 2
    assert dryrun_result.max_stack_height() == 2
    assert dryrun_result.status() == ("REJECT" if x == 0 else "PASS")
    assert dryrun_result.final_scratch() == ({} if x == 0 else {0: x})
```

#### Declarative Blackbox Dry Run Sequence Assertions

**STEP 9**. The TEAL Blackbox Toolkit also allows for declarative style test writing. 
Let's look at some sample assertions for our `lsig_square` TEAL program:

```python
    "lsig_square": {
        "inputs": [(i,) for i in range(100)],
        "assertions": {
            DRProp.stackTop: lambda args: args[0] ** 2,
            DRProp.maxStackHeight: 2,
            DRProp.status: lambda i: "REJECT" if i[0] = 0 else "PASS",
            DRProp.finalScratch: lambda args: ({} if args[0] else {0: args[0]}),
        },
    },
```

In the parlance of the TEAL Blackbox Toolkit, a set of such declarative assertions
is called a **test scenario**. Scenarios are dict's containing two keys `inputs` and `assertions` and follow [certain conventions](https://github.com/algorand/py-algorand-sdk/blob/3d3992ccc9b3758f28e68d2c00408d2e1363a3bb/algosdk/testing/teal_blackbox.py#L942). In particular:

* **inputs** are lists of tuples, each tuple representing the `args` to be fed into a single dry run execution
* **assertions** are dicts that map [DryRunProperty](https://github.com/algorand/py-algorand-sdk/blob/3d3992ccc9b3758f28e68d2c00408d2e1363a3bb/algosdk/testing/teal_blackbox.py#L20)'s to actual assertions
* here is a [live example scenario](https://github.com/algorand/py-algorand-sdk/blob/c6e91b86acf545b66a94d27581d6cfa6318206fc/x/blackbox/blackbox_test.py#L442) for $`x^2`$

In English, letting $`x`$ be the input variable for our square function, the above **test scenario**:

* provides a list of 100 tuples of the form $`(x)`$ that will serve as args.
  * IE: $`(0), (1), (2), ... , (99)`$
* establishes 4 different _sequence assertions_ as follows:
  * the **stack's top** will contain $`x^2`$
  * the **max stack height** during execution is always 2
  * the executions' **status** is **PASS** except for the case $`x=0`$
  * the **final scratch** will have $`x`$ stored at slot `0` except for that strange $`x=0`$ case (recall the [0-val scratch slot artifact](#0val-artifact))

Declarative sequence assertions make use of the following:

* `DryRunProperty` (aka `DRProp`): an enum that acts as a key in a scenario's assertions dict
* class `SequenceAssertion`
  * its constructor takes in a predicate (there are [4 kinds of predicates](#predicate)) and returns a callable that is used for runtime assertions
  * method `inputs_and_assertions()` validates a scenario and extracts out its assertions
  * method `dryrun_assert()` evaluates the dry-run sequence using the constructed `SequenceAssertion`

To employ the declarative test scenario above write the following:

```python
algod = get_algod()

scenario = {
    "inputs": [(i,) for i in range(100)],
    "assertions": {
        DRProp.stackTop: lambda args: args[0] ** 2,
        DRProp.maxStackHeight: 2,
        DRProp.status: lambda i: "REJECT" if i[0] = 0 else "PASS",
        DRProp.finalScratch: lambda args: ({} if args[0] else {0: args[0]}),
    },
},
mode = ExecutionMode.Signature

# Validate the scenario and dig out inputs/assertions:
inputs, assertions = SequenceAssertion.inputs_and_assertions(scenario, mode)

# Execute the dry runs and obtain sequence of DryRunTransactionResults:
dryrun_results = Executor.dryrun_logicsig_on_sequence(algod, teal, inputs)

# Sequence assertions:
for i, prop_n_predicate in enumerate(assertions.items()):
    property, predicate = prop_n_predicate
    assertion = SequenceAssertion(predicate)
    assertion.dryrun_assert(inputs, dryrun_results, property)
```
  
**STEP 10**. _**Deep Dive into Sequence Assertion via Exercises**_

There are <a name="predicate">4 kinds of Sequence Assertions _aka_ predicates</a>

1. _simple python types_ - these are useful in the case of _constant_ assertions. For example above, it was
asserted that `maxStackHeight` was _**ALWAYS**_ 2 by just using `2` in the declaration `DRProp.maxStackHeight: 2,`
2. _1-variable functions_ -these are useful when you have a python "simulator" for the assertable property. For example above it was asserted that `stackTop` was
$`x^2`$ by using a lambda expression for $`x^2`$ in the declaration `DRProp.stackTop: lambda args: args[0] ** 2,`
3. _dictionaries_ of type `Dict[Tuple, Any]` - these are useful when you want to assert a discrete set of input-output pairs. For example, if you have 4 inputs that you want to assert are being squared, you could use

```python
DRProp.stackTop: {
  (2,): 4,
  (7,): 49,
  (13,): 169,
  (11,): 121
},
```

>Note that this case illustrates why `args` should be tuples intead of lists. In order to specify a map from args to expected, we need to make `args` a key
>in a dictionary: Python dictionary keys must be hashable and lists are **not hashable** while tuples _are_ hashable.

4. _2-variable functions_ -these are useful when your assertion is more subtle than out-and-out equality. For example, suppose you want to assert that the `cost` of each run is _between_ $`2n \pm 5`$ where $`n`$ is the first arg of the input. Then you could declare `DRProp.cost: lambda args, actual: 2*args[0] - 5 <= actual <= 2*args[0] + 5`

#### **EXERCISE A**
Convert each of the lambda expressions used above to dictionaries that assert the same thing.
#### **EXERCISE B**
Use 2-variable functions in order to _ignore_ the
weird $`x=0`$ cases above.

#### _PARTIAL SOLUTIONS to EXERCISES_

**Exercise A Partial Solution**. For `DRProp.status`'s declaration you could define the `dict` using dictionary comprehension syntax as follows:

```python
DRProp.status: {(x,): "PASS" if x else "REJECT" for x in range(100)},
```

**Exercise B Partial Solution**. For `DRProp.status`'s declaration you could ignore the case $`x=0`$ as follows:

```python
DRProp.status: lambda args, actual: "PASS" == actual if args[0] else True,
```

## Slow and Bad Fibonacci - Another Example Report

[This](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ax-jQdYCkKT61Z6SPeGm5BqAMybgkWJa-Dv0yVjgFSA/edit?usp=sharing) is an example of `app_slow_fibonacci.teal`'s Dryrun stats:
<img width="1231" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/291133/158705149-302d755f-afcc-4380-976a-ca14800c138f.png">
A few items to take note of:

* $`n`$ is given by **Arg_00**
* the app was **REJECT**ed for $`n = 0`$ because `fibonacci(0) == 0` is left at the top of the stack
* the app was **REJECT**ed for $`n > 7`$ because of exceeding budget
* the app **errored** only for $`n > 16`$ because of exceeding _dynamic_ budget
* the **cost** is growing exponentially (poor algorithm design)
* the **top of stack** contains `fibonacci(n)` except in the error case
* the **final_log** contains `hex(fibonacci(n))` except in the error and reject cases
* **max stack height** is $`2n`$ except for $`n=0`$ and the error case
* you can see the final values of scratch slots **s@000** and **s@001** which are respectively $`n`$ and `fibonacci(n)`

You can see how [sequence assertions can be made](https://github.com/algorand/py-algorand-sdk/blob/77addfc236e78e41e2fd761fd59b506d8d344346/x/blackbox/blackbox_test.py#L324) on this function.
